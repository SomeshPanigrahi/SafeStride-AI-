## About the Project

SafeStride AI solves a critical problem in sports science: **athletes often train either too hard or too little without understanding workload balance.** This leads to overtraining, injury risk, poor recovery, and inconsistent performance.

SafeStride AI combines:
- 📊 Training data collection & logging
- 🧮 Sports-science workload analytics (ACWR)
- 📈 Interactive visualization dashboards
- 🤖 AI-generated personalized coaching insights
- 🚨 Injury risk prediction & alerts

### Target Users

| Primary | Secondary |
|---|---|
| Runners & endurance athletes | Rehabilitation trainers |
| Fitness enthusiasts | Performance analysts |
| Coaches | University sports labs |

## Features

### 🔬 ACWR-Based Injury Risk Prediction
Implements real sports-science methodology — calculating acute (7-day) and chronic (28-day) workload ratios to assess injury probability from sudden training spikes.

### 🤖 AI Coaching Insights
Generates personalized feedback, workload explanations, and training suggestions — transforming raw data into an intelligent training assistant.

### 📊 Modern Sports Analytics Dashboard
- KPI cards (ACWR, acute load, chronic load)
- Dynamic risk color-coded badges
- Workload trend charts (Area & Bar)
- Responsive, data-driven UI states

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
JWT-based stateless authentication with bcrypt password hashing and protected API routes.

### ☁️ Full Production Deployment
- Frontend → Vercel
- Backend → Render
- Database → MongoDB Atlas

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB Atlas account
- AI API key (for coaching insights)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/safestride-ai.git
   cd safestride-ai
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../Frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**

   Create `Backend/.env`:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   AI_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key
   ```

   Create `Frontend/.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

5. **Run the development servers**

   Backend:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open** `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## API Reference

### Auth Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Register new user | No |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Login & receive JWT | No |

**Register body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Somesh",
  "email": "test@test.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

### Run Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/runs` | Log a new training run | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/runs` | Get all runs for user | ✅ |
| PUT | `/api/runs/:id` | Update a run | ✅ |
| DELETE | `/api/runs/:id` | Delete a run | ✅ |

### Analytics Endpoints

## ACWR Analytics

### What is ACWR?

**Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio** is a sports-science metric used by elite sports organizations to predict injury risk from sudden training load spikes.

```
ACWR = Acute Load (7-day) / Chronic Load (28-day)
```

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Acute Load** | Short-term fatigue — recent 7-day workload |
| **Chronic Load** | Long-term fitness — 28-day rolling average |

### Risk Classification

| ACWR Range | Risk Level | Action |
|---|---|---|
| < 0.8 | 🔵 Low | Consider increasing training load |
| 0.8 – 1.3 | 🟢 Optimal | Maintain current training balance |
| 1.3 – 1.5 | 🟡 Warning | Reduce intensity — recovery needed |
| > 1.5 | 🔴 High Risk | Immediate load reduction recommended |

### Workload Formula

```
Daily Load = Duration (min) × Intensity (1–10 scale)
```

---

## Deployment

### Live URLs
- **Frontend:** https://safe-stride-ai.vercel.app
- **Backend:** Hosted on Render

### CORS Configuration

```javascript
origin: [
  "http://localhost:5173",
  "https://safe-stride-ai.vercel.app"
]
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Linux servers (Render) are case-sensitive. Ensure all import paths match exact filenames — `AuthContext.jsx` ≠ `Authcontext.jsx`.

---

## Security

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Password hashing | `bcryptjs` |
| Authentication | JWT (stateless, scalable) |
| Request validation | `Joi` schema validation |
| Route protection | `protect` middleware on all private routes |

### Authentication Flow

```
Register → Hash password → Store user → Issue JWT
Login → Compare bcrypt → Issue JWT → Frontend stores token
Request → Axios interceptor attaches Bearer token → protect middleware verifies
```
